Sponsorship Opportunities
RISC-V Forum short-form virtual events provide deep exploration into a single-topic that is important and timely to the RISC-V Community. The Forums are a unique opportunity to connect with the RISC-V community.

Four events, each on a specific topic, with one sponsor. Sponsor one or multiple events and even partner with another RISC-V member, and gain visibility with your target audience.

- Security such as the latest trends, tools in the RISC-V ecosystem, trusted execution, crypto acceleration, side channel attacks
- Developer tools and tool chains including compilers, performance, analyzers
- Embedded Technology including IoT, industrial IoT, controls, and industrial controls
- Embedded Industry such as automotive, graphics cards, medical equipment, disk drives, and communications


Why sponsor?
#1: Sponsors receive the leads from the event. RISC-V does not!

Some other good reasons :)

- Educate the community on your work in the specific Forum topic area and meet the attendees who are interested in that topic.
- Take advantage of a professionally organized conference run by a neutral nonprofit where content is curated by the community.
- Associate your brand with one of the fastest-growing open source hardware technologies.
- Support and engage with the RISC-V ecosystem and community.


RISC-V is promoting these events via Linux Foundation emails, newsletters, and social as well as via our email lists and paid social. Our goal is to bring 200-300 highly targeted attendees to each event.

Sponsorship is only open to RISC-V Members. The cost for one event is $5,000.
